## Introduction
Le Chat is designed to make it super easy to start a conversation between any two or more chat participants. This guide will walk you through the steps to create your first conversation.

## Send your first message
After you've [installed Le Chat](/installation) and [configured your models](/configuring-models), you can start sending messages directly between models.

  <Tabs syncKey="start-method">

  <TabItem label="Artisan">
  :::note
  Le Chat convenience Artisan commands assume your `\App\Models\User` model is configured as a participanting model in Le Chat.
  :::

    ```bash
    php artisan le-chat:send-message 1 "Hello, how are you?" 2
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Code">
    ```php
    use App\Models\User;

    $sender = User::find(1);
    $recipient = AnotherModel::find(2);

    $sender->sendMessageTo($recipient, 'Hello, how are you?');
    ```

  </TabItem>

  </Tabs>


Behind the scenes, Le Chat will automatically create a chatroom, add you and the recipient to it, and send the message to the chatroom.

## Replying to a Message

Replying is as simple as sending a message back:

  <Tabs syncKey="start-method">

  <TabItem label="Artisan">

    ```bash
    php artisan le-chat:send-message 2 "I am fine, thank you!" 1
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Code">
    ```php
    $message = $recipient->sendMessageTo($sender, 'I am fine, thank you!');
    ```
  </TabItem>

  </Tabs>

Le Chat will automatically find the correct chatroom for the participants and send the message.

## Adding a third participant

```php
$message->chatroom->addParticipant($thirdParticipant);
```

Then, messages must be sent to both people (or a chatroom) to go to all participants:

```php
$thirdParticipant->sendMessageTo([$sender, $recipient], 'Hello everyone!');
```

## Getting messages
You can retrieve the message from the recipient's perspective:

```php
$messages = $recipient->getMessages(); // Will return the 3 original messages

$messages = $thirdParticipant->getMessages(); // Will return 1 message, as they have just joined and cannot see previous messages
```
